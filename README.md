Chatbot Code Repository
This repository contains the core Python scripts for the Chatbot Application designed using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The chatbot is built to perform various NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis, language translation, text classification, and plagiarism detection.

🚀 Features
Chatbot Logic: Processes user queries dynamically with context-aware responses.
Sentiment Analysis: Detects the emotional tone of input text (Positive, Negative, Neutral).
Language Translation: Converts text between multiple languages accurately.
Text Classification: Categorizes text into predefined labels for better organization.
Plagiarism Detection: Ensures originality using cosine similarity.
